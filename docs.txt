The selected code is a part of a Tetris game implementation. It contains the App class, which is responsible for initializing the game, drawing the grid, and updating the game area. The Tetromino and Block classes are also defined, which are used to draw individual blocks and tetromino shapes on the canvas.

Here's a brief explanation of the selected code:

1.
The App class is initialized with the canvas element, sets its dimensions, and gets the 2D rendering context.
2.
The start method is called to begin the game loop. It sets an interval for the updateGameArea function to be called at a specified frame rate (1/FPS seconds).
3.
The updateGameArea function is responsible for updating the game area. It first clears the canvas, then updates the game, and finally draws the updated game area.
4.
The drawGrid function is called within the draw function to draw the grid on the canvas. It iterates over the canvas dimensions and draws a white border around each grid cell.
5.
The draw function is called within the updateGameArea function to draw the grid and a test Tetromino shape. It creates a new Tetromino object, sets its position and shape, and then calls its draw method to render it on the canvas.
6.
The update function is called within the updateGameArea function, but it currently does not have any functionality.
7.
The clear function is called within the updateGameArea function, but it currently does not have any functionality.
8.
The Tetromino class is defined with a constructor that takes the x and y coordinates, the shape, and the rendering context as parameters. It also has a draw method that renders the Tetromino shape on the canvas by iterating over its blocks and drawing them as individual Block objects.
9.
The Block class is defined with a constructor that takes the x and y coordinates and the rendering context as parameters. It also has a draw method that renders a filled rectangle on the canvas at the specified coordinates.


In summary, the selected code is a part of a Tetris game implementation that initializes the game, draws the grid, and renders a test Tetromino shape on the canvas.
